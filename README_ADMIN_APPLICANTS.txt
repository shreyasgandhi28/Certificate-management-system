/*
 * To use the new admin applicant listing and detail pages:
 *
 * 1. Include the new routes in your main routes/web.php:
 *      require base_path('routes/admin_applicants.php');
 *
 * 2. Ensure you have the spatie/laravel-permission package set up for role-based access.
 *
 * 3. The new UI is modern, responsive, and supports light/dark mode with high contrast.
 *
 * 4. You can further extend the ApplicantController for verification actions and audit logging.
 *
 * 5. No existing code or routes are changed.
